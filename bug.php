This code suffers from a silent failure. If the file at `$filePath` does not exist, `file_get_contents()` will return `false`, but the code will continue to execute without any error handling.  This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes later on.

```php
$filePath = '/path/to/file.txt';
$fileContent = file_get_contents($filePath);
//Process $fileContent (which might be FALSE)
```
